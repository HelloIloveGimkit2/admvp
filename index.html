    <h3>What is ADMVP?</h3>
    <p>
      ADMVP is an exploit capable of completely activating developer mode on
      enterprise-managed Chromebooks. It was found by
      the <a href="https://discord.gg/unblock">Titanium Network and me (kokichi)</a> and
      was released on November,
      <u onclick="alert(messages.monday)">Monday the 18th</u>, 2024.

      If you don't know what is developer mode then go to <a href="https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/boot-modes/developer.html">this information page</a>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section green">
    <h3>What you will need</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A brain.</li>
      <li>
        <u onclick="alert(messages.pc)">A chromebook</u>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <i>IMPORTANT: ALL YOUR DATA WILL BE DELETED WHEN POWERWASHING VIA DEVELOPER MODE</i>
    <hr />
    <h3>Executing on Chromebook</h3>
    <p>
      enter recovery mode on your Chromebook. This
      is done by pressing the power button (⏻), reload key (↻), and ESC key at the
      same time. Your screen should look one of the images below:
    </p>
    <img src="assets/recover_black.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="Recovery mode (groot UI)" />
    <img src="assets/recover_white.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="Recovery mode (old UI)" />
    <p>Press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> on this screen, then press enter.</p>
    <p>
      It will now say something about "returning to secure mode" or that "OS
      verification is off". You will not actually be in developer mode,
      but the exploit will work regardless. Your screen should look like one
      of the images below:
    </p>
    <img src="assets/confirm_black.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="TONORM (groot UI)" />
    <img src="assets/confirm_white.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="TONORM+FWMP (old UI)" />
    <p>
      or if it isn't blocked by system policy skip down a little
      On this screen, press enter again. This will disable developer mode and powerwash the device
    </p>
    <p>
      Once it powerwashes just try that again until you get a screen without any sort of system policy block
    </p>
    <p>
      press CTRL + D once you get on a "os verification is off" screen without system policy
    </p>
    <hr />
      <h3>What now?</h3>
      <p>
        well after the 5 minute timer is over you can press CTRL + ALT + →
      </p>
