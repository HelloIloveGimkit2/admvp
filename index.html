        Activating Developer Mode Via Powerwash

    <h3>What is ADMVP?</h3>
    <p>
      ADMVP is an exploit capable of completely activating developer mode on
      enterprise-managed Chromebooks. It was found by
      the <a href="discord.gg/unblock">Titanium Network and me (kokichi)</a> and
      was released on November,
      <u onclick="alert(messages.monday)">Monday the 18th</u>, 2024.

      If you don't know what is developer mode then go to <a href="https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/boot-modes/developer.html">this information page</a>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section green">
    <h3>What you will need</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A brain.</li>
      <li>
        <u onclick="alert(messages.pc)">A chromebook</u>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <i>IMPORTANT: ALL YOUR DATA WILL BE DELETED WHEN POWERWASHING VIA DEVELOPER MODE</i>
    <hr />
    <h3>Executing on Chromebook</h3>
    <p>
      enter recovery mode on your Chromebook. This
      is done by pressing the power button (⏻), reload key (↻), and ESC key at the
      same time. Your screen should look one of the images below:
    </p>
    <img src="assets/recover_black.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="Recovery mode (groot UI)" />
    <img src="assets/recover_white.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="Recovery mode (old UI)" />
    <p>Press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> on this screen, then press enter.</p>
    <p>
      It will now say something about "returning to secure mode" or that "OS
      verification is off". You will not actually be in developer mode,
      but the exploit will work regardless. Your screen should look like one
      of the images below:
    </p>
    <img src="assets/confirm_black.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="TONORM (groot UI)" />
    <img src="assets/confirm_white.png" style="width: auto; height: 350px" alt="TONORM+FWMP (old UI)" />
    <p>
      or if it isn't blocked by system policy skip down a little
      On this screen, press enter again. This disable developer mode and powerwash the device
    </p>
    <p>
      Once powerwashes just try that again until you get a screen without any sort of system policy block
    </p>
    <p>
      press CTRL + D once you get on a "os verification is off" screen without system policy
    </p>
    <hr />
      <h3>What now?</h3>
      <p>
        well after the 5 minute timer is over you can press CTRL + ALT + →
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that while unenrolled, it is recommended to add your personal
        account first, then add your school account, then switch between the two
        as needed. Mercury Workshop does not condone the use of SH1MMER or
        unenrolling to cheat in school.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest challenges with unenrolling are connecting to the school
        network and taking state or national exams (since there are no kiosk
        apps anymore).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many methods to get a school Wi-Fi password while enrolled,
        including
        <a href="https://luphoria.com/netlog-policy-password-tool">the policy netlog trick</a>. While on a school
        account
        and unenrolled, you can bypass some network-level blocks
        by using a secure DNS such as Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 from
        <kbd>chrome://os-settings/osPrivacy</kbd>. It is also recommended to
        enable "MAC Address Randomization" in <kbd>chrome://flags</kbd> to stay
        hidden.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/secure_dns.png" alt="Secure DNS" />
      <img src="assets/mac_randomization.png" alt="MAC Address Randomization" />
      <p>
        To take a kiosk exam, the safest option is to re-enroll temporarily.
        Instructions for doing that are hosted
        <a href="assets/kiosks.txt">at this TXT file</a>. Saving a copy of this file
        for future reference is probably a smart move.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also use <a href="https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/fakemurk">fakemurk</a>
        as a way to enroll your device but stay in developer mode and have control
        over policies and extensions. You may need to use this to get WiFi passwords
        if <kbd>chrome://net-export</kbd> is blocked.

    <h3>The Fog...</h3>
    <h4>(Google's response, and why this might not be working for you)</h4>
    <p>
      Downgrading and unenrollment has been patched* by google. If your chromebook has never updated to version 112
      before (check in <kbd>chrome://version</kbd>), then you can ignore this and follow the normal instructions. If not,
      unenrollment will not work as normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you aren't willing to take apart your chromebook to unenroll, you can use an affiliated project,
      <a href="https://fog.gay">E-HALCYON</a> to boot into a deprovisioned environment temporarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are willing to take apart your Chromebook to unenroll, then go to the guides
      here: <a href="unpatch.html" target="_self" >Unpatch</a> and <a href="unfog.html" target="_self" >Unfog</a>
